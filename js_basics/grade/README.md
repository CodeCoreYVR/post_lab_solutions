# Grade

### Question:

Write a script that takes a number as argument that must be between 0 and 100. If the number is smaller or larger, log "Invalid grade". Otherwise, calculate their letter grade from "F" to "A" then log it. Try using BC's letter grading system (it's short).


```

$ node index.js 22
F

$ node index.js 98
A

$ node index.js 69
C+
```
