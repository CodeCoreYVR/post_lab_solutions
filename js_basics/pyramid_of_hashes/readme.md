Write a script pyramid.js that takes a number as an argument then logs a pyramid of # with that many number of rows.

Example usage:

$ node pyramid.js 4
   #
  # #
 # # #
# # # #

You must log the pyramid as one string instead of logging multiple times for each row. Try running the code console.log('First line\nSecond line\nThird Line') in the node REPL! It should give you some direction.
