Create an object that represents a deck of playing cards.

It will have a property cards that contains an array of all 52 cards including all clubs, spades, hearts and diamonds. Use a loop to generate the cards instead of adding each manually. The cards should be represented as an object with the properties: suit & number.

Example Deck with a few Cards:
```
const deck = {
  cards: [
    { suit: "hearts", number: 1 },
    { suit: "spades", number: 10 },
    ...
  ]
}
```
Additionally, add the following methods to the deck:

shuffle will randomly reorder the cards in the deck.
draw will remove and return the top card of the deck.
reset method which resets deck to all 52 cards.
